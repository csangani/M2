M2
==

M2 is a tool to measure similarity of software code. 

It is inspired from MOSS (http://moss.stanford.edu), but aims to provide much-required features
such as bipartite matching of files instead of clique matching, support for newer languages, and
a friendlier UI.

M2 is currently under development, and is not ready for production use. Interfaces currently defined
are highly likely to change, and so are the command line options.

Please contact the author if you have ideas, feature requests, or if you have noticed a bug.
